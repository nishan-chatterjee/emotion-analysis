Higher concentration, longer attention span, lower appetite, more sociable.  It was awesome. But over the years the side effects have caught up to me.  Increased sweating, higher pulse rate, higher blood pressure, lower quality of sleep, dazed. My shoulder muscles are so tense all the time its almost painful.  I&#039;m prescribed 60mg a day, and that used to be great, but now if I take more than 30 mg my sleep quality suffers to the point where I&#039;m a zombie the next day.  Then I have to take more to feel normal, then I can&#039;t sleep again the next night.  But if I don&#039;t take it, I&#039;m completely useless for about 4 days.

135979,Acamprosate,Alcohol Dependence,"""A few comments regarding my and others&#039; experiences here. I have been on campral three times over the last 15 years so have a bit of experience here.

This is not a magic bullet. If you are not seeing a professional d and a counsellor for at least a year after detox you will set yourself up for relapse.

You will need to be on this for at least a year to allow your counselling and brain to kick into recovery. Don&#039;t fool yourself that once your cravings magically disappear that you are cured. It takes dedication to stay out of the trap and the middle aged coffin.

If you do relapse (read fool yourself that controlled drinking is possible for an alcoholic) keep taking the campral, double your counselling and pour the rest in the sink.""",8,4-Nov-16,21
