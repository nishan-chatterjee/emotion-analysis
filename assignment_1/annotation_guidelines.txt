Task Description

Annotate instances of the dataset of reviews retrieved from drugs.com with Eckman's 6 fundamental emotions.

Annotation Guidelines

1) Annotate the emotion(s) of the author of the review
	--> do not annotate bodily afflictions (and their presumed emotional affect)- only annotate
	the emotional state as expressed linguistically
	--> do not distinguish between emotions that come as a result of taking a drug and emotions
	expressed toward the drug
2) Identify any of the 6 emotions of Eckman's model (anger, fear, joy, surprise, disgust, sadness)
3) If an emotion occurs, specify the intensity (low, normal, high)
4) Each instance (taking the drug event) is split into two parts: before taking the drug, and after taking the drug
5) Annotate a maximum of 2 emotions in both parts of an instance (if possible)
	a) if 3 emotions are present, only annotate the 2 most prominent emotions
	b) it may be possible that before or after are not mentioned; in this case leave it out
6) Try to be aware of your overall annotations- beware of falling into patterns of annotation (Basically check if a lot of entries have very similar scores).

Task 1:
Annotate 15 random samples from the dataset and check annotation scores across annotators. If there isn't a correlation of (whatever value of similarity), re-evaluate/discuss Annotation Guidelines. Otherwise keep annotating.
