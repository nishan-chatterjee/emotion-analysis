Task Description

Annotate instances of the dataset of reviews retrieved from drugs.com with Eckman's 6 fundamental emotions.

Annotation Guidelines

1) Annotate the emotion(s) of the author of the review
2) Identify any of the 6 emotions of Eckman's model (anger, fear, joy, surprise, disgust, sadness)
3) If an emotion occurs, specify the intensity (low, normal, high)
4) Each instance (taking the drug event) is split into two parts: before taking the drug, and after taking the drug
5) Annotate a maximum of 2 emotions in both parts of an instance (if possible)
	a) if 3 emotions are present, only annotate the 2 most prominent emotions
	b) it may be possible that before or after are not mentioned; in this case leave it out
