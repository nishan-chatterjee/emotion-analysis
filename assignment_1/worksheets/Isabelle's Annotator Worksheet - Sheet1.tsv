	32104							Wellbutrin X			2 Normal				does not mention emotion before, only that they feel better now	Helped better than any other antidepressant I have taken (&amp; there have been a few!)  Major depressive disorder is a tricky one. Still working on that (20 yrs.  now), but I&#039;m function able.	
	224119							Budesonide					2 Normal			I have developed irritation of the throat and ears, headache, feel dizzy during my morning walk, chest pain and difficulty with my breathing.	
	28132		3 High		3 High			Lexapro		1 Low		1 Low			depression (sad) and anxiety (fear) before in high intensity, after in lower doeses (a bit better)	Ok so a bit of backstory. I have had anxiety and depression since I was 7 due in part to abuse. I was not diagnosed until a couple months ago. About 3 weeks ago I finally admitted I needed more then therapy to get thru this and went to my doctor and was given lexapro 10mg. I feel a little better, but I still feel anxious and depressed almost constantly, the only real change I have noticed is that when I get an attack it feels less frantic and I am able to just wait till the horrible feeling dies down. I also have not been sleeping well. I can&#039;t sleep at night sometimes it&#039;s the anxiety sometimes I just can&#039;t feel tired. I get 2-3 hours once the sun comes up but no matter how tired I am all day I can&#039;t sleep at night. Appointment next week.	
	26323							Sprintec	3 High					 	"getting tired" sounds like frustration, therefore anger	I just start this pills this month and start my period the Saturday before Christmas and I&#039;m on the white pill that suppose to start your period on and I&#039;m still having it. If it keep&#039;s up I will all so be having my period for 2 weeks. I&#039;m  getting tired of bleeding and the pain that comes with it. Thank you.	
	165354							Ethinyl estradiol / folic acid / levonorgestrel	3 High		1 Low				joy for "acne cleared up", anger for "really angry"	There are few good things with this birth control and a few bad. \r\r\n1. My adult acne has cleared up. \r\r\n2. Makes me want to eat EVERYTHING a week or 2 after my period. So you gain weight. \r\r\n3. Makes me really angry, really quick.	
	122516	2 Normal						Linaclotide			3 High			3 High	before: nothing worked (frustration therefore anger) and after: very happy (joy) and surprised  ("and it worked!" sounds like she had doubts, was surprised)	I am SO happy with this medication! I&#039;ve struggled with chronic constipation for so long I forgot what it feels like to have a &quot;normal&quot; BM. My constipation was so bad that I&#039;ve had frequent visits to the ER for severe abdominal cramps (comparable to labor pains), and each time I was told I had severely dilated colon and impaction. I&#039;ve been on lactulose, Mirilax, Go-lytly, laxative teas, and even drinking a bottle of Magnesium-Citrate. NOTHING worked. Now I&#039;m on a daily dose of Linzess and I HAVE to share my success story with others. It worked! And I couldn&#039;t be happier!	
	52442	2 Normal						Pantoprazole			2 Normal				"tried everything" sounds frustrated (anger) maybe hopeless? didnt add that though... afterward, seems happy he/she can eat anything (joy)	"Tried everything, been on Protonix for 5 years. I can now eat anything as spicy and as hot as I like, and do not have acid reflux."	
	191138							Campral			1 Low				no mention of emotion before, seems positive (happy) that drinkng cravings not as intense anymore	Been on it for 3 days. Want a drink but not as bad as usual...drank 12 pack a day. Been drinking for almost 40 yrs.	
	109404							Nexplanon							no mention of emotion before, but after she felt tired and sluggish- perhaps this evokes frustration? sadness? I'm not sure so have indicated none	The implant is very effective for preventing pregnancy. The only issues I had was the side effects. It make me extremely sleepy and   Exhausted. The side effects didn&#039;t kick in right away but after some type I notice the changes and decided to have it removed. I am no longer feeling tired and sluggish.	
	231275							Trazodone	3 High				3 High		no emotion before, after was very clearly angry and disgusted at ineffectiveness of medication	I guess I&#039;m in the group of people that had severe reaction to this medication. The doctor prescribed 100mg trazodone for my &quot;eyes wide open in bed throughout the night&quot; problem. I took caution for the first night and took half a pill or 50mg but after about half an hour my heart stared beating really fast and arrhythmic, my ears and forehead become really hot, etc. it took an hour, two glasses of cold water and trying to breath normally for it to pass. A horrible experience which I won&#039;t forget. Next day I went to my doc and yelled angrily that if I had taken full dose it could have killed me and his reaction was something like oops! seems like this med is not for you! \r\n\r\nShort version : my advice is to take a small dose at first ,if ok then increase	
	46775							Sulindac			3 High				definitely happy that there's no more pain	I have taken this medication for 3 months, and it is the first time in 5 years I have been practicaly pain free!	
	4308							Capsaicin							I couldn't find any emotions here	Shingles 5 years ago , chronic PHN Trigeminal Upper Branch Nerve Pain Discomfort since , used Lidoderm Lidocaine patch , that lost it&#039;s ability to relieve , tried other topical creams Eucerin skin calming creme w/ drop of Geranium Oil mixed and worked into affected area , after awhile that lost it&#039;s ability as well .\r\nTonight tried Capzacin again , used years ago didn&#039;t do much , yet tonight it did , we&#039;ll see tomorrow .	
	148027					1 Low		Norethindrone	2 Normal				2 Normal		before: gets sick from other pilss, after: seems frustrated (anger) and dislikes the pill (disgust)	I&#039;ve been on this for of BC because I generally get sick on combo pills. I was told by my PCP that it&#039;d help control my cycle and make a bit more predictable. I&#039;ve been on it for under a month and I&#039;m already not liking it. I started it the first day of my cycle; bleeding seemed to get heavier with large clots (normally med-heavy with very small clots), constant headache, and I&#039;ve broken out with very painful zits on my chin and forehead (skin is generally clear). Skin is oily now as well. I&#039;ll definitely be looking for a different type of BC.	
	45568		2 Normal		2 Normal			Fluoxetine			2 Normal		3 High		before: depression (sadness) and anxiety *fear), after: feels ill (disgust) but also feels mood/anxiety is under control	I&#039;m 19, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and told to take fluoxetine. I have been on it for 3 weeks and since then I have stopped having panic attacks but have experienced some horrible side effects, including headaches, vomiting, heartburn (that lasted hours), insomnia, fits of giggles, lethargy, muscle aches, loss of libido, dizziness, sensitivity to light and a general feeling of not being altogether. So, the medication has stopped my low mood and constant anxiety, but has made me feel ill.	
	191687				1 Low			Lisdexamfetamine			3 High				before: low mood (sadness, though low), after: defintiely very happy and motivated	I am 20 years old and just started taking this medication because I was having trouble in school wrapping my head around the massive amount of data we have to learn at school. I have noticed a HUGE improvement on my comprehension while reading in my book, and much more interested and focused on everything my instructor says during the period of class time, and I actually remember it. It helps me complete my projects in school and stay focused on one task instead of walking around aimlessly wasting time seeing what everyone else is doing and saying &quot;I can just do that tomorrow, or later on.&quot; I can finally sit down and get things done the way I should be. No crashing at the end of the day, or jitteriness.	
1	157250							Ceftin		2 Normal	3 High				no emotion before, after perhaps joy because of "excellent" (seems happy with outcome, "high" because excellent is a high degree as opposed to good or great) but also fear because "I am concerned" but at medium degree because could be "very/extremely concerned"	Did excellent job with clearing up sinus infection.  4 days in, however, I got hit with pretty severe diarrhea. Dr. had me stop taking since I was so much improved in terms of the sinusitis and due to the side effects. Been 48 hrs of diarrhea.  And 24 since I terminated the medication. Hopefully it resolves with the probiotics I&#039;m taking and cessation of the Ceftin. I am concerned about the severe colitis I&#039;ve read about but we shall see.	
2	52502							Armour Thyroid							no emotions	this is my second day of taking Armour.  I may have to get used to it.  I haven&#039;t slept well since I have taken it.  I feel very alert and not relaxed.  I am going to stick with it since it is more of a balance of t3 and t4, I hope.  I was getting no results from levothyroxine.	
3	6528	1 Low						Sodium biphosphate / sodium phosphate			2 Normal				before: frustration (tried everything)= anger, after: joy (relief)	I have been trying everything for the last 9 days to produce a bowel movement. Everything from propylene glycol powder, to stool softener tablets, to trying even the suppository stool softeners and nothing was working. At the request of my doctor I tried Fleet enema. Well it did not completely evacuate my bowels on the first try, which is all I&#039;ve done so far, it did at least listen the plug that was blocking me up. The relief was immediate, and I would recommend nothing short of Fleet enema. I hope it works as well for you as it did for me.	
4	13633							Amphetamine / dextroamphetamine			3 High	1 Low			after: very happy (best, problems were solved...) but also unhappy (sad) because "if I take more.. suffers"	I have taken Adderall for over 6 yrs now. At first it was the best!  All my problems were solved. Higher concentration, longer attention span, lower appetite, more sociable.  It was awesome. But over the years the side effects have caught up to me.  Increased sweating, higher pulse rate, higher blood pressure, lower quality of sleep, dazed. My shoulder muscles are so tense all the time its almost painful.  I&#039;m prescribed 60mg a day, and that used to be great, but now if I take more than 30 mg my sleep quality suffers to the point where I&#039;m a zombie the next day.  Then I have to take more to feel normal, then I can&#039;t sleep again the next night.  But if I don&#039;t take it, I&#039;m completely useless for about 4 days.  Therefore, I can&#039;t stop taking it	
5	143094							Etonogestrel							no emotions? I was thinking perhaps sadness (after) because she says "sucking it up" which means there is some hardship..	Got the Nexplanon 10/6/16 . I got on it to prevent pregnancy and so far I haven&#039;t got pregnant. When I first got on it I didn&#039;t bleed for one week. Now most days just a really heavy flow other days golf ball size clots. Recently just started to be both clots and a very heavy flow. Mood swings are bad some times I get really bad cramps where I can&#039;t feel from my uterus down &amp; headache are unbearable. I been just sucking it up until I have to get the Nexplanon taken out (10/6/2019)	
6	36856							Fentanyl							No emotion, just description of bodily pain	my husband was taking over 10 hydrocodoine pills a day for his back pain until he found a dr. that finally helped him and has got him on duragesic 75 patches he has done so much better with his pain that we get along so much better .the only time he is having some pain now is when it is almost time for his patch to be changed to a new one.	
7	91681							Protonix IV			3 High				saved my life = joy	I perforated a stomach ulcer, at age of only 33 y/o, and Protonix saved my life (after emergency surgery). ;-)	
8	101780							Methocarbamol							no emotions really	I have sciatica. It took this medicine a couple of days to take effect on me but it finally did. It&#039;s okay.	
9	111694							Cipro							same	It gives me heartburn and dizziness.  Makes me feel off-center.	
10	201196	3 High			3 High			Zoloft			3 High				before: high anger (irritable) and sadness (depression) and after: high joy (feel so much better, weight lifted from shoulders)	I&#039;ve been on the generic sertraline 50mg for about two weeks , and I feel so much better . I was very depressed , irritable , had insomnia and felt like a total failure at life . I had a little diarrhea at first, but then I also have IBSD so I wasn&#039;t surprised . After a few days that stopped . I feel like my Old self again , like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders . I&#039;m even singing again , I haven&#039;t done that in about a year . I was in denial for a long time , I told myself I could handle the depression -I was wrong . This is the first anti-depressant I&#039;ve been on and I am very pleased with how much it has helped me.	
11	48008							Naproxen / sumatriptan						0 Not Annotated	no emotions	I get horrible menstrual migraines. I&#039;ve tried medicines in the past. Some didn&#039;t work, some worked but gave me a rebound headache. Then I started trying natural remedies. Some help, but nothing has gotten rid of my migraines. I decided to give another medicine a try because I expected a migraine to come on a day I had an important event. My doctor gave me a sample of Treximet. My migraine started coming on DURING the event. I took one pill, and within 20 minutes I could feel the pain lessen. I&#039;d say within an hour it was completely gone. It&#039;s now been 2 days and I have not gotten a rebound headache. I also don&#039;t remember much of a side effect. I felt a little out of sorts for a bit, but that went away fairly quickly.	
12	135979							Acamprosate							uhhh no emotions (just instructions?)	A few comments regarding my and others&#039; experiences here. I have been on campral three times over the last 15 years so have a bit of experience here. This is not a magic bullet. If you are not seeing a professional d and a counsellor for at least a year after detox you will set yourself up for relapse. You will need to be on this for at least a year to allow your counselling and brain to kick into recovery. Don&#039;t fool yourself that once your cravings magically disappear that you are cured. It takes dedication to stay out of the trap and the middle aged coffin.If you do relapse (read fool yourself that controlled drinking is possible for an alcoholic) keep taking the campral, double your counselling and pour the rest in the sink.	
13	113691							Arthrotec			3 High			3 High	miracle = surprise (high), fantastic = joy (high), also no mention of emotions before	I was prescribed Arthrotec 75/0.2MG. I had spinal surgery on L5 in 2001 by an orthopedist and in 2009 on same disc by a neurosurgeon. In 2009, I took a long time to recover. Also, I am suffering from degenerative disc disease on S1 to the point of self fusion (a good thing as it stabilized my lower back). In 2009, I was prescribed  Arthrotec 75 / 0.2MG I found this to be a miracle. I only take it as needed and only when it wears off. Once a week or as needed. FANTASTIC results! It takes years off my body. I am 62.	
14	11600	1 Low						Pramipexole	1 Low						before: anger (bothersome because frustrated/bothered), and still low anger after because still 'trouble' in other areas (sleep)	This somewhat reduced my restless legs syndrome (which occurs every other day and is enough to keep me up at night and be bothersome); however, this gave me insomnia, specifically causing me trouble falling asleep and once I was finally able to fall asleep, I would wake up once every two hours or so.	
15	200855							Varenicline				3 High			afer: high sadness because depression & fatigue	I gave this drug rating of 5 because I have seen it do well for many people. However, I went CRAZY after starting this medicine. I watched 4 people take this medicine and do very well and quit smoking. If it was not for a friend that I had not spoke to in weeks calling me I would have done even worse. When she contacted me I explained my symptoms of fatigue, depression, and even crazier things. She then told me the exact same thing happened to her on Chantix. I have quit smoking before. My advice: Try this medication but HAVE SOMEONE WATCH YOU FOR SIDE-EFFECTS.	
16	187249							Sodium oxybate						3 High	before: no mention; after: very surpised (actually worked), cant tell what emotion wrt pain....	Xyrem actually worked! For the first time in my life, I felt like a normal person. Then, the migraines to beat all migraines began. I was awake but in so much pain and the only thing that helped at all was packing ice all around my head. I hoped the headaches would go away but, after a couple of weeks, I gave up. I didn&#039;t want to be awake with that much pain.	
17	6764							Beyaz	3 High			3 High			after: very angry, very sad.... mentions that these were not emotions before. But does not mention any present emotions (eg happy etc..) so none annotated for before	I started BeYaz because it was recommended by a new PA I&#039;m seeing.  SHe said it would help with the PMS symptoms I described.  I&#039;ve nearly completed the first pack and I am feeling completely out of control, depressed, even suicidal, and irritable and SO angry.  I DID NOT feel this way before, even at my worst PMS times.  I started my period about a week before I should have this month.  I don&#039;t know if I should continue using this pill or not.  It just dawned on me that it could be the BeYaz, and after reading the pamphlet and now these postings, I think the BeYaz may be why I&#039;ve been having these overwhelming symptoms.	
18	176053							Neo-Poly-Dex							no emotion	This medication caused my eyes to swell, sacks like fluid under each one, dried my skin all around both eyes and caused redness. After 3 days my eyes started to itch. Returned to the doctor after 2 days and was told to use cold compresses and Benadryl for 5 days. It has been four days and the swelling and dry skin is still around the eyes.	
19	180757							Dienogest / estradiol			3 High				high joy (best bc pill) after. No before.	I was started on this pill over 2 and a half years ago. I had tried a lot of different BC pills and read about Natazia online and asked my obgyn if I could go on it. This has been THE best bc pill I&#039;ve been on! I rarely have periods if any and don&#039;t have any side effects.	
20	26789							Ulipristal		3 High	2 Normal				after: fear, high (frantically researching, very scary, stress you out), also happy, medium (did the job)	I took EllaOne about an hour after having sex with my partner. The condom burst, it was an unfortunate accident. This happened 6 days before I was due my cycle, which is quite regular. The only side effect I had endured was breast tenderness for a few days afterwards.  No spotting or bleeding. On the day I was due my period, I suffered abdominal pains which I wouldn&#039;t have associated with cycle pains. When my period didn&#039;t come, that is when I started frantic researching; reading forums can be very scary and stress you out even more. I had a tendency to latch onto negative experiences. I stressed myself out to the point of sickness. My period arrived 2 days late and I know that EllaOne did the job :) Every body is unique. Relax!	
21	111364							Ledipasvir / sofosbuvir							no emotion	I am 68 years old and was told about 25 years ago that I had had Hep C. I had no side effects from the virus. I am active swimming and during Yoga. Went to John Hopkins because my Primary Doctor was concerned since my VL was 16,000,000. I was stage 3 Fibrosis of the liver.. I took Harvoni for four  weeks and the HCV is not detected. I will continue the med for 8 more weeks. This stuff works.	
22	90917							Norco			1 Low				works great seems happy to me?	Works great for my pain.	
23	101452							Ciclesonide			1 Low				it is wonderful seems happy too	I was on a dose of 20 mg of prednisone daily and have been able to stop taking any oral steroids since I started Omnaris.  I have had no side effects.  It is wonderful. It helps my runny and stuffy nose symptoms. 	
24	18848							Solifenacin				3 High			miserable = high sadness	Been having cold like symptoms. Running nose, sneezing, stomach pain, constipation, heart beating too fast. I&#039;ve been taken only 4 days but stopped today. Side effects are too much and they&#039;re making me miserable.	
25	220718							Loestrin 24 Fe							no emotion	I&#039;ve been on this pill since summer 2007 (three years) for extreme menstrual cramps and bleeding (I spent roughly 16 hours passed out from pain for two days every month and bleed for 7-10 days straight. I used so many OTC pain killers that they all ceased to work for me). My experiences with this pill: -No weight gain noticed. Lost pre-pill weight by exercising.  -Little to no pain compared to before (1-2 pain pills for the worst two days for about every 3rd period) -Little to no bleeding (I went from super heavy pads to the lightest pads on the market or just dark colored underwear on my heaviest days . Some months, I just don&#039;t bleed) -No extra mood swings (and less mood swings during my period) -Acne is the same (not better, not worse)	
26	113321							Bisacodyl			2 Normal				after: joy, normal (feel much better)	I couldn&#039;t poo for days.. Then I took these pills at 8pm and went to bed at 11pm I then woke up at 1:30am with the worst tummy pain ever I got out of bed and had a little spew. Then I sat on the toilet it began coming out then  until 7pm that night. I have to say the pain was very bad but it was much better then being blocked up and my bowel motions not coming out. I would definitely take these again I feel much better now	
27	178615							Victoza			2 Normal				after: joy, normal (I'm so happy...)	I started Victoza exactly 4 weeks ago. I have felt nauseous from time to time but generally feel worse if I eat more than I needed. I can easily feel very full eating 700-800 calories a day. I haven&#039;t had any other side effects except that I have way more energy than before which is wonderful for someone who has fibromyalgia and is always tired!!  The inches are melting away and I&#039;m so happy to have lost 11.5lbs, it&#039;s amazing!  After unexplained weight gain of 77lbs over the course of a year this is just what I needed. 1 month in and 1/6 of the weight I need to lose has already gone - if you haven&#039;t already, give it a go.	
28	105876							Atomoxetine	3 High			3 High			this one's a lot. Lost it (anger) crying (sadness) depressed (sadness) screaming (anger) breakdown (sadness)	Started taking  60mg of this medicine for ADD &amp;  anxiety triggered my ADD. It took about a week to hit my system, while it helped somewhat with my ADD. It wasn&#039;t major. I was still forgetting things like crazy and was able to be side tract. It&#039;s been 13 days and I&#039;m stopping it today. It has made me an emotional WRECK!!!! I&#039;ve had CRAZY mood swings like seen in a damn horror movie. Yesterday, I woke up happy then saw puppy shit on the floor and I LOST IT. I was a crying wreck. It was so bad I laid on my floor and screamed tears! I&#039;ve never been depressed insane. Couldn&#039;t find my shoes- crying screaming mess again. Left the laundry in the washer over night- another HUGE breakdown.	
29	60021							NuvaRing			2 Normal				after: joy (love it)	Wonderful birth control. My fiance feels the Nuvaring but doesn&#039;t mind. No side effects and it doesn&#039;t affect my depression. It occasionally moves the wrong way but is easy enough to move back in to place. I don&#039;t have to remember to take it at any one time and only have to remember anything for it twice a month. Love it!	
30	161765		3 High					Remeron	3 High	1 Low					before: fear (panic disorder) but high, after: low fear (died down). then Anger (rages, irritability)	I have a panic disorder and my doctor put me on the Remeron. I thought it was great at first. It caused my panic attacks to slow down and my anxiety to die down. Then the side effects started. I had an increased appetite and put on nearly 30lbs. I didn&#039;t mind that, but then it also began causing me to become very irritable. I started feeling like I was going into blind rages. I immediately contacted my doctor and switched medicines. Use caution.	
31	108121							Ethinyl estradiol / norelgestromin							no emotions	This is my first birth control ever - after I had an abortion on July. Decided to take on the patch because it is easy and convenient and you don&#039;t have to remember to take everyday, just once a week and my change patch day is every Monday. On my patch-free week today, menses came. Tomorrow will be my second month wearing it and so far so good. Side effects are mainly headache and a big appetite however no weight gain, no breakouts and some spotting in between. Cons, will be lint adhere to the patch and it could be itchy for me once in a while.	
32	74738							Keppra				3 High	2 Normal		after: dont like keppra at all (disgust, normal) and sadness, high (suicidal, cry..)	I dont like using keppra at all. Since the start of using keppra, I keep on having suicidal thoughts everyday which I don&#039;t want to have. Keppra is making my life worse than ever. My mood is changing every minute. It has impacted my schoolwork so much. I have trouble remembering things and being happy. Sometimes I cry so hard  and say to myself &quot;I can&#039;t take this drug anymore&quot;. My self esteem is getting very low everyday. This drug is destroying my relationship with my friends and family. I just want to be able to tell them and my school what my feelings are and not pretend to put a mask of happiness over my face.	
33	112082							Gabapentin							no emotion	I haven&#039;t been taking this medication for long but it&#039;s helped so much. Neuro started me off on 300mg at night and now I&#039;m at 600mg at night. It doesn&#039;t make me sleepy or drowsy. Before starting gabapentin, I was having migraines just about every day. I started having aphasia and vision changes with my migraines, so I decided to take action. I&#039;ve only been on it for almost 2 weeks but I&#039;ve been migraine free and my triggers are no longer triggers at this point, which is fantastic. I should note it has reduced my appetite but this is not a negative thing.	
34	67842							Plan B		3 High	3 High				after: fear, high (freaked out) and joy, high (so happy)	I did &#039;&#039;it&#039;&#039; on september 12,2016 &amp; on september 17 I recieved brown spotting slightly pickish I thought it was implantation &quot;period&quot; I started to freak out really bad but SO HAPPY IT IS NOT. I NOW HAVE MY HEAVY PERIOD with fatigue the pill works! Just take it as soon as it happens or within the 24 hour range best.drink warm teas for the cramping! Or hot baths. Love you all! Be careful!	
35	58200							Acetaminophen / hydrocodone							none	Was very beneficial when taken with a muscle relaxer for extreme pain in neck and arm. I was also taking Naproxen.	
36	194430							Crestor							none	15 minutes after taking I would get severe leg cramps for hours. It made my good cholesterol bad it did not work for me.	
37	57981							Acetaminophen / hydrocodone			2 Normal				after: joy, normal (the best x2)	The best medicine for me. I have tried all of the pain medicines and this one works the best along with Soma.	
38	80527							Mobic						3 High	after: surprise, high (miracle)	Mobic - the miracle pill. I have had chronic pain in my right knee for the last 6 months or so, it was getting worse by the day. I have now been taking Mobic 15mg for two days and I have no pain at all. I have read that there can be some nasty side effects, but at the moment I really don&#039;t care. I can walk pain free again.	
39	107103							Implanon		1 Low	3 High				after: joy, high (love it), fear, low (have gotten scared)	I have been on the Implanon for almost two years, I&#039;m getting it replaced and putting in a new one sometime in January. I absolutely love it, I don&#039;t get my period for months at a time, my longest one was two months. When I do get it, it is the same I&#039;ve always bled in the beginning of it, and after the first week or so it&#039;s nothing but a light bleeding if hardly any at all. I would recommend it, but you also have to take into consideration that any birth control affects people differently depending on how your body reacts to it. I love it, and have gotten scared about pregnancy since I had my daughter in March of 2010, but that&#039;s only from not getting it for months at a time. I haven&#039;t gotten pregnant when I should have. I love it.	
40	82083							Liraglutide			2 Normal				after: joy, normal (feel normal- relief? = joy)	For the first time in my life I feel normal. Dec 2011 I has gastric sleeve surgery. (Due to pcos and being pre diabetic ) Going in I weighed 352. I lost nearly 100#s. Over the past few years I&#039;ve gained 70 back. I work on the road and had no willpower when it came to coworkers stopping for fast food. Saying no is easy now. I&#039;m unsure how much I&#039;ve lost as my scale is broke, but I&#039;m back in my &quot;skinny jeans&quot; (snug but I couldn&#039;t come close to clasping them prior to saxenda. I pretty much force every meal down, and actually have to count calories to ensure I&#039;m getting enough! My main side effect has been nausea. Eatting a few bites feeling like I ate a buffet.	
41	36051							Efinaconazole							none	Using for one month working great on my big toenail	
42	199717				3 High			Varenicline			2 Normal				before: sadness, high (depression), after: joy, normal (helped my mood, grateful)	5 years ago I used chantix to quit smoking. I had tried everything over the years I smoked and chantix was the only thing that ever stopped me from smoking. It even helped my mood. I suffer from depression and the chantix helped my mood during the time I used it. I am grateful for this medication	
43	87913							Clindamycin							no emotion (maybe disgust? Doesnt like this drug at all)	I was prescribed cleocin (clindamycin) for an infected tooth.  I have never had this antibiotic before, called the pharmacist and was told to drink a lot of water because it has a tendency to cause diarrhea.  Well I stayed on it for five days while enduring terrible stomach cramps and uncontrollable diarrhea until I came to my senses.  I called the dentist and switched to augmentin which did the trick.  Now, ten days later, I&#039;m still recovering from the side effects of the cleocin.  I will never take this antibiotic again.  There are too many alternatives to endure these reactions, let alone the fact that this drug strips your body of probiotics that affect the colon and can cause serious, and yes, even fatal consequences.	
44	95202							Guanfacine			3 High				after: joy, high (greatly impoved, I was so happy...)	My 9 year old son has been taking Intuniv for about a year now and has greatly improved his behavior, mood, impulse control and more. Both myself and his dad suffer from ADHD as well but need Adderall to manage. I was so happy to see a non-stimulant medicine work so well. The only problem we&#039;ve had is excessive weight gain (excess of 30 lbs in 1 year). To the point its very worrisome. Appointment is set to switch to something new.	
45	213570							Tioconazole					2 Normal		no emotions? Maybe disgust because "horrible"	So after reading all the comments, I now know its not just me:( Went and got the monistat 1, put it in about 1 today. Felt fine till about 30 minutes ago. Oh my!!!! My inside are on itchy fire. This is horrible. I&#039;m hoping at least it works for all this pain. I can say I will never use this AGAIN!!! What helps with some kind of relief ladies??? Help please	
46	67613							Plan B			3 High				after: joy, high ("yay")	On May 18th this guy came completely inside of me and he wasn&#039;t wearing a condom/I wasn&#039;t on birth control. Around 5 hours later I took plan B. On May 22nd I got my &quot;period&quot; which I later learned was withdrawal bleeding but anyways it was really heavy for a few days and then got progressively lighter. I had spotting for about a week and a half after the heavy days which has never happened to me but I read the pill can make your cycle irregular so I didn&#039;t worry too much about it. Around 11 days after the &#039;act&#039; I took a test and it was negative. I waited a week and took another test (so 18 days after the &#039;act&#039;) and it was negative! Not pregnant!! Yay!!	
47	77194							Lorcaserin			1 Low			3 High	after: surprise, high (very impressed), maybe also joy, low bc implied (because it worked, very impressed)	I started one week ago taking 2 per day as prescribed but forgot 2 days to take second dose at work, so last 4 days only taking 10mg in morning. Not hungry at all. Eating mostly Paleo diet, some cardio exercise, and have lost 6.9 pounds in last 1 week. I am very impressed! Slight headache, dizziness, &quot;high&quot; feeling first few days, but have gone away.	
48	71473							Levora			2 Normal				after: joy, normal (great pill for me)	This is my first experience with birth control, and so far it has been a very positive one.  I have been on it for about 2 months.  Before I had breakouts all of the time, and only a few days after starting this, I noticed that my acne had close to disappeared. Also, I used to have some problems with facial hair. That also has disappeared. I have had no mood swings, weight gain, or decrease in sexual drive or wetness. My weight has actually been easier to maintain, and I have lost about 10 pounds. All in all, this has been a great pill for me.	
49	67453							Provera							none	I was bleeding for 7 weeks lightly and then all of a sudden it came and I was passing large clots and a lot of blood. My doctor put me on Provera 10mg twice a day. I had a horrible headache and felt tired but my period did stop which is great.	
50	182008							Egrifta							none	I had a problem with visceral fat as a side effect of my HIV meds. My doctors convinced me that Egrifta could reduce the density of my visceral fat and after using it for just over 7 months my affected area has had a softening and reduction of fat but I have had one unexpected and undesirable effect....my penis seem to be noticeably not as thick as it has been my entire life. While my husband says its no big deal it is to me! Has anyone else had this &quot;side effect&quot;?
