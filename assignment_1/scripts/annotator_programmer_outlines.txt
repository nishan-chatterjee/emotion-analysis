Ways to code this problem?

    1. Parse the sentence and determine where the break point is: formulate the scene of how the patient felt before and after taking the drug.
    2. If no conditional information is given on how they felt before taking the drug, assign closest sentiments of how they felt based on the conditional improvement they state.
    3. If there is zero mention of how they felt after or before, then assign sentiment to the symptoms and how that generally makes a person feel.
    4. Give different weights to 1, 2, and 3 and then add them up to formulate a general model of understanding.
    5. Showcase emotions around a certain drug and project its sentiments into an emotional embedding space.


1. Take the Personality Test
2. Send the annotations to you - 50
3. Do annotations 15+50
4. Write code to calculate from file
5. Check guidenlines from git
