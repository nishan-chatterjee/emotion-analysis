28132,Lexapro,Generalized Anxiety Disorde,"""Ok so a bit of backstory. I have had anxiety and depression since I was 7 due in part to abuse. I was not diagnosed until a couple months ago. About 3 weeks ago I finally admitted I needed more then therapy to get thru this and went to my doctor and was given lexapro 10mg. I feel a little better, but I still feel anxious and depressed almost constantly, the only real change I have noticed is that when I get an attack it feels less frantic and I am able to just wait till the horrible feeling dies down. I also have not been sleeping well. I can&#039;t sleep at night sometimes it&#039;s the anxiety sometimes I just can&#039;t feel tired. I get 2-3 hours once the sun comes up but no matter how tired I am all day I can&#039;t sleep at night. Appointment next week.""",7,4-Sep-15,25

122516,Linaclotide,"Constipation, Chronic","""I am SO happy with this medication! I&#039;ve struggled with chronic constipation for so long I forgot what it feels like to have a &quot;normal&quot; BM. My constipation was so bad that I&#039;ve had frequent visits to the ER for severe abdominal cramps (comparable to labor pains), and each time I was told I had severely dilated colon and impaction. I&#039;ve been on lactulose, Mirilax, Go-lytly, laxative teas, and even drinking a bottle of Magnesium-Citrate. NOTHING worked. Now I&#039;m on a daily dose of Linzess and I HAVE to share my success story with others. It worked! And I couldn&#039;t be happier!""",10,21-Nov-16,45

231275,Trazodone,Insomnia,"""I guess I&#039;m in the group of people that had severe reaction to this medication. The doctor prescribed 100mg trazodone for my &quot;eyes wide open in bed throughout the night&quot; problem. I took caution for the first night and took half a pill or 50mg but after about half an hour my heart stared beating really fast and arrhythmic, my ears and forehead become really hot, etc. it took an hour, two glasses of cold water and trying to breath normally for it to pass. A horrible experience which I won&#039;t forget. Next day I went to my doc and yelled angrily that if I had taken full dose it could have killed me and his reaction was something like oops! seems like this med is not for you! 

Short version : my advice is to take a small dose at first ,if ok then increase """,1,31-Jan-17,52

148027,Norethindrone,Birth Control,"""I&#039;ve been on this for of BC because I generally get sick on combo pills. I was told by my PCP that it&#039;d help control my cycle and make a bit more predictable. I&#039;ve been on it for under a month and I&#039;m already not liking it. I started it the first day of my cycle; bleeding seemed to get heavier with large clots (normally med-heavy with very small clots), constant headache, and I&#039;ve broken out with very painful zits on my chin and forehead (skin is generally clear). Skin is oily now as well. I&#039;ll definitely be looking for a different type of BC.""",1,11-Mar-16,1
45568,Fluoxetine,Depression,"""I&#039;m 19, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and told to take fluoxetine. I have been on it for 3 weeks and since then I have stopped having panic attacks but have experienced some horrible side effects, including headaches, vomiting, heartburn (that lasted hours), insomnia, fits of giggles, lethargy, muscle aches, loss of libido, dizziness, sensitivity to light and a general feeling of not being altogether. So, the medication has stopped my low mood and constant anxiety, but has made me feel ill.""",5,18-Nov-13,11
191687,Lisdexamfetamine,ADHD,"""I am 20 years old and just started taking this medication because I was having trouble in school wrapping my head around the massive amount of data we have to learn at school. I have noticed a HUGE improvement on my comprehension while reading in my book, and much more interested and focused on everything my instructor says during the period of class time, and I actually remember it. It helps me complete my projects in school and stay focused on one task instead of walking around aimlessly wasting time seeing what everyone else is doing and saying &quot;I can just do that tomorrow, or later on.&quot; I can finally sit down and get things done the way I should be. No crashing at the end of the day, or jitteriness.""",10,8-Dec-11,14
